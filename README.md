# Hello, world!

This example project is written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### Objectives
- Familiarize yourself with the process of running the autograding tests and submitting PRs via GitHub Classroom and your Java IDE

### The assignment

- The tests are currently failing because of an output mismatch.
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
  - Fixing the `System.out.println` in the main method will make the tests green.
- Submit your solution and submit a pull request (any branch name will do) 
  - GitHub actions will run unit tests and _should_ only allow PRs and merging.

### Running this locally

Running this locally requires a JDK and Gradle.

Once everything is installed:

```bash
